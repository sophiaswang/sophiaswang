**Timeline**<br>
January 2025

**Tasks**
* User Research
* UX/UI Design
* Branding
* Prototyping
* Usability Testing

**Background**<br>
Homeowners have been shifting towards replacing grass lawns with native plant landscaping solutions that reduce maintenance and water consumption by up to 75% and allow native wildlife and pollinators to thrive and display unique seasonal beauty.

**Goal**<br>
Empower homeowners to make smart and sustainable landscaping decisions. Through AR visualization of potential plant options and a simple interface allowing users to learn about the native plants that have potential to thrive in their unique yard environments, FloraVision will naturally encourage landscaping decisions moving towards beauty, sustainability, and joy. The app will also enable community members to share gardening knowledge and contribute to local environmental stewardship projects.

**Competitor Analysis**<br>

Based on the competitive analysis of apps and websites providing plant selection and landscape planning information, I found a few key strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:
* Geographic Location Integration: Most platforms utilize location data to provide region-specific plant recommendations. This is a crucial feature for ensuring plants are suitable for local climates.
* User Preference Integration: A majority of the platforms allow users to customize their plant selections based on personal preferences. This enhances user experience and satisfaction.
Environmental Factors Integration: Many platforms consider environmental factors such as soil type, sunlight, and moisture conditions. This is essential for plant survival and thriving.

Weaknesses:
* Local community engagement: Only one platform offers users the ability to connect with plant enthusiasts in the area. There is high potential for an app that enhances this part of the experience, as gardening is a skill and hobby that can spread easily through communities.
* AR visualization: Providing an easy way to test out landscape design ideas and customize recommendations based on immediate environment conditions streamlines the process of yard planning and improvement.
Notable platforms:

Wild Ones Native Garden Designs stands out by providing region-specific garden designs for various ecoregions in the U.S., considering user skill level, budget, and environmental factors, encouraging community engagement through local chapters providing support for gardeners.

Neighborbrite uses AI to analyze user-uploaded yard photos and generate tailored designs based on location, user style preferences, and environmental conditions

Ecoregional Revegetation Application (ERA) offers a robust filtering system allowing users to select plants based on ecoregions, preferences, and environmental factors
Market gaps and opportunities include an app that balances usability and clean design with geographically tailored suggestions for native plants. There is space for a simple, modern alternative to extensive, information heavy databases that allows for customized visualization, with the aim of improving environmental and visual outcomes while connecting local communities around a sustainable cause. The ideal app would integrate community features, allowing users to exchange gardening knowledge, information, and services and local conservation organizations to post upcoming environmental stewardship and volunteer opportunities.

**User Research**<br>

I conducted interviews with five homeowners with varying levels of gardening experience to learn more about the community needs and pain points existing in this area.

Common themes that emerged included feeling uncertain about gardening choices and capabilities and the difficulty of ongoing garden maintenance, especially in regards to finding help within the community. Homeowners acknowledged the environmental benefits of native plants but were often wary of the additional time, effort, and lengthy onboarding process of official habitat certification programs like the Backyard Habitat Certification Program in the Portland metro area.

The following user personas represent shared experiences, concerns, and goals that emerged through my conversations with neighbors.

<br><br>

**User Flows**

Key considerations: <br>
Allow users the option to skip AR plant previews and go straight to comprehensive plant data finder
Keep account creation at the end of onboarding process, after users have a chance to explore app features and find plants that fit their environment
